# Nice to see you here! We are Ko-Station.

**Ko-Station** a knowmad community established in 2022 in Rotterdam by four Ukrainians living in The Netherlands. We are united by our collective experiences, common values, and a shared mission.

We are eager to share experiences through meaningful discussions and the creation of new ideas. Here members are safe to mention any topics on meet-ups and deliver creative thoughts at any time. Our main goal is sharing knowledge and multiplying thoughts and actions connected to it.

## How are we doing that? 

1. **Public meet-ups**

    Ko-Station consists of participants who have experience in various spheres of life. Be it IT, or cultural studies, or historical sciences, or neurobiology. At the public meet-ups, we have the opportunity to discuss any aspect of life and find support from a friendly community. We all are here to encourage, learn, and share. Bring your friends here too!

2. **Chatting in WhatsApp**

    Yep, we are a lively community. And we don’t need to wait for the next big meet-up to share great experiences today and now. It’s more than welcome to ask: “Great weather today! Would anybody want to go outside for a walk?”, “*name of artist* will be in Amsterdam soon. Does somebody want to go together?” 

3. **Podcast. “Ukraine 101”**

    This podcast is in progress, but it is also a nice form of sharing ideas and experiences. Here, you can. But it is also a nice form of sharing ideas and experience. Here you would be able to listen to more sincere and unfamiliar information about Ukraine from Ukrainians. 

This community is changing simultaneously with its members. We are ready for your feedback and notions because knowmads thrive on adaptability and innovation. 

Let's co-create a space where everyone's voice shapes our collective journey!
