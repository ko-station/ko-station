On Nov 19th, we explored “A Story of Ukrainian Student Activism” at Leiden University, The Hague.

From bold ideas to meaningful conversations, it was a rendezvous filled with connection and inspiration.

A special thanks to our partners, student association [ABBA](https://www.instagram.com/abba.association.leiden/) , for making this event possible.

How was it? Check out the photos!
