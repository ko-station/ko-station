On Thursday, November 14th, [Menno](https://www.instagram.com/mennozahn/) guided us through the family saga and a magically realistic novel by the Dutch-Ukrainian writer [Lisa Weeda](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Weeda), “Aleksandra.” As a third-generation migrant, Menno felt a connection with the protagonist’s quest for family roots. She embarks on a journey to the very East of Ukraine. As she travels, she learns a lot about Ukraine, its past and present, and herself. Together, we shared about our own families, communities, and homes. 

Thank you everyone for coming! And special gratitude to [De Graaf Florisstraat](https://www.graafflorisstraat.nl/) for welcoming us into the space.


Dear friends, if you missed rendezvous with the Ko-Station, don’t worry—there’s always a next time! Stay tuned for more magical gathering moments!
